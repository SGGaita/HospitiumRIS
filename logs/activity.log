Current clinical risk assessments lack the sensitivity to accurately predict progression in high-risk individuals. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) and the gut microbiome are emerging as critical regulators in metabolic homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. This study aims to investigate the synergistic predictive power of integrating these two distinct molecular biomarkers for EO-T2DM risk.\\n\\nMethods: We will conduct a prospective, case-control study involving three groups: EO-T2DM patients, high-risk individuals (with pre-diabetes or strong family history), and healthy controls. Baseline clinical data, plasma, and fecal samples will be collected. Circulating miRNA profiles will be determined via Next-Generation Sequencing, and gut microbial communities will be characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis will identify differentially expressed miRNAs and key microbial taxa. Integrated statistical modeling and machine learning algorithms will be applied to assess the correlation between significant molecular features and to construct a composite predictive biomarker model for EO-T2DM risk.\\n\\nObjectives: The primary objectives are to characterize the individual profiles of circulating miRNAs and the gut microbiome in EO-T2DM, explore the cross-talk between these two systems, and ultimately develop a novel, highly sensitive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker signature.\\n\\nExpected Impact: The identification of an integrated miRNA-microbiome biomarker signature will offer a non-invasive, more precise tool for stratifying individuals at high risk for EO-T2DM, paving the way for targeted lifestyle and therapeutic interventions that could significantly alter disease progression.\",\n          milestones: [\n            {\n              title: \"Full Ethics Approval and Finalized Study Protocol.\",\n              targetDate: \"2026-07-01\",\n              description: \"• Finalize study protocol and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). • Submit for Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee approval. • Establish clinical site agreements and secure necessary reagents/equipment. • Initial recruitment strategy development and advertisement preparation.\"\n            },\n            {\n              title: \"≈50% of Target Cohort Recruited and Samples Biobanked.\",\n              targetDate: \"2027-07-15\",\n              description: \"• Primary Activity: Recruit cohort (Early-Onset T2DM patients, At-Risk individuals, and Healthy Controls). • Collect baseline clinical data, blood samples (for microRNA analysis), and fecal samples (for microbiome analysis). • Establish a robust biobanking system for sample storage.\"\n            },\n            {\n              title: \"All Samples Processed; High-Quality MicroRNA and Microbiome Sequence Datasets Generated.\",\n              targetDate: \"2027-02-01\",\n              description: \"• MicroRNA Analysis: RNA extraction, sequencing/qPCR validation of circulating miRNAs. • Microbiome Analysis: DNA extraction, 16S rRNA sequencing, and/or shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples. • Initial quality control and preliminary data generation.\"\n            },\n            {\n              title: \"Milestone: Final Statistical Models Complete; Identification of Predictive Biomarker Signature.\",\n              targetDate: \"2028-01-01\",\n              description: \"• Bioinformatics processing: Sequence alignment, taxonomy assignment, and diversity analysis (microbiome). • Differential expression analysis (microRNA). • Key Analysis: Integrated statistical modeling to assess the predictive power of combined microRNA and microbiome signatures for T2DM risk.\"\n            },\n            {\n              title: \" Final Manuscript(s) Submitted; Project Close-out and Final Report Delivered.\",\n              targetDate: \"2029-01-15\",\n              description: \"• Comprehensive interpretation of integrated findings. • Draft and submit ≥2 peer-reviewed manuscripts. • Present findings at national/international conferences. • Prepare and submit the final grant report.\"\n            }\n          ],\n          deliverables: [],\n          fundingSource: \"National Health Institute\",\n          grantNumber: \"\",\n          fundingInstitution: \"NHI\",\n          grantStartDate: new Date(\"2026-01-15T00:00:00.000Z\"),\n          grantEndDate: new Date(\"2029-12-15T00:00:00.000Z\"),\n          totalBudgetAmount: 200000,\n          ethicalConsiderationsOverview: \"This study is committed to the highest ethical standards as defined by the Declaration of Helsinki and institutional guidelines.

Current clinical risk assessments lack the sensitivity to accurately predict progression in high-risk individuals. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) and the gut microbiome are emerging as critical regulators in metabolic homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. This study aims to investigate the synergistic predictive power of integrating these two distinct molecular biomarkers for EO-T2DM risk.\\n\\nMethods: We will conduct a prospective, case-control study involving three groups: EO-T2DM patients, high-risk individuals (with pre-diabetes or strong family history), and healthy controls. Baseline clinical data, plasma, and fecal samples will be collected. Circulating miRNA profiles will be determined via Next-Generation Sequencing, and gut microbial communities will be characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis will identify differentially expressed miRNAs and key microbial taxa. Integrated statistical modeling and machine learning algorithms will be applied to assess the correlation between significant molecular features and to construct a composite predictive biomarker model for EO-T2DM risk.\\n\\nObjectives: The primary objectives are to characterize the individual profiles of circulating miRNAs and the gut microbiome in EO-T2DM, explore the cross-talk between these two systems, and ultimately develop a novel, highly sensitive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker signature.\\n\\nExpected Impact: The identification of an integrated miRNA-microbiome biomarker signature will offer a non-invasive, more precise tool for stratifying individuals at high risk for EO-T2DM, paving the way for targeted lifestyle and therapeutic interventions that could significantly alter disease progression.\",\n          milestones: [\n            {\n              title: \"Full Ethics Approval and Finalized Study Protocol.\",\n              targetDate: \"2026-07-01\",\n              description: \"• Finalize study protocol and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). • Submit for Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee approval. • Establish clinical site agreements and secure necessary reagents/equipment. • Initial recruitment strategy development and advertisement preparation.\"\n            },\n            {\n              title: \"≈50% of Target Cohort Recruited and Samples Biobanked.\",\n              targetDate: \"2027-07-15\",\n              description: \"• Primary Activity: Recruit cohort (Early-Onset T2DM patients, At-Risk individuals, and Healthy Controls). • Collect baseline clinical data, blood samples (for microRNA analysis), and fecal samples (for microbiome analysis). • Establish a robust biobanking system for sample storage.\"\n            },\n            {\n              title: \"All Samples Processed; High-Quality MicroRNA and Microbiome Sequence Datasets Generated.\",\n              targetDate: \"2027-02-01\",\n              description: \"• MicroRNA Analysis: RNA extraction, sequencing/qPCR validation of circulating miRNAs. • Microbiome Analysis: DNA extraction, 16S rRNA sequencing, and/or shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples. • Initial quality control and preliminary data generation.\"\n            },\n            {\n              title: \"Milestone: Final Statistical Models Complete; Identification of Predictive Biomarker Signature.\",\n              targetDate: \"2028-01-01\",\n              description: \"• Bioinformatics processing: Sequence alignment, taxonomy assignment, and diversity analysis (microbiome). • Differential expression analysis (microRNA). • Key Analysis: Integrated statistical modeling to assess the predictive power of combined microRNA and microbiome signatures for T2DM risk.\"\n            },\n            {\n              title: \" Final Manuscript(s) Submitted; Project Close-out and Final Report Delivered.\",\n              targetDate: \"2029-01-15\",\n              description: \"• Comprehensive interpretation of integrated findings. • Draft and submit ≥2 peer-reviewed manuscripts. • Present findings at national/international conferences. • Prepare and submit the final grant report.\"\n            }\n          ],\n          deliverables: [],\n          fundingSource: \"National Health Institute\",\n          grantNumber: \"\",\n          fundingInstitution: \"NHI\",\n          grantStartDate: new Date(\"2026-01-15T00:00:00.000Z\"),\n          grantEndDate: new Date(\"2029-12-15T00:00:00.000Z\"),\n          totalBudgetAmount: 200000,\n          ethicalConsiderationsOverview: \"This study is committed to the highest ethical standards as defined by the Declaration of Helsinki and institutional guidelines.
