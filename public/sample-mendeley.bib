    abstract={Background: Immunocompromised patients have reduced immune responses to vaccines and increased risk of severe COVID-19. We assessed the efficacy and safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in this population. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Results: mRNA vaccines demonstrated reduced but significant immunogenicity in immunocompromised patients with acceptable safety profiles.},
